A simple python library for imaging protoplanetary disc simulated with 2D FARGO.

For more details and examples see the **disc_imaging.ipynb** jupyter notebook.

Note that I created this library with the 'quick and dirty' behaviour as a Summer Student at Konkoly Observatory in 2016. Thus I reccommend to use my code carefuly and modify it to your own taste! Also take into account that this is my first code uploaded to github.

## Dependencies

The required dependiences to run the script:

- [Python][] version 3.0+
- [Numpy][] >= 1.11.3
- [Matplotlib][] >= 2.0

The script was tested on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS release.

## Contribution & Development

For development reccomended to use [Git][] verson control tool.

The package goal is to be an alternative tool for the visulaization for the output of 2D FARGO simulations using python. Any contribution should be done trough [GitHub][] pull request system. All submitted code should be well-commented and documented. It is reccomended to also submit an example for the submitted funcitons.
